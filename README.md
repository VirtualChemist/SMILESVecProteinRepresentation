# SMILESVecProteinRepresentation

ProtVec and SMILESVec representations are built based on [Word2vec](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) model by Mikolov et al. Gensim implementation was used to build word-embeddings.

****************************************************************
## Getting Started
### Folders 

"data" folder contains the input and output files.

	
"source code" folder contains python source code.

Embeddings files are provided in [here](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~hakime.ozturk/smilesvec.html)


### Prerequisites

You'll need to install following in order to run the codes.

```
Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x
numpy
sklearn
```


## Options

### get SMILESVec for given SMILES
```
will be updated
```

### get SMILESVec-based representation for given protein (UniProt ID)
```
will be updated
```

### SMILESVec-based Protein Similarity for SCOP A-50
```
will be updated
```
